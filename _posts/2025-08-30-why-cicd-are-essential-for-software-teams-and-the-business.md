In modern software development, speed and quality are everything. Customers expect rapid updates, bug fixes, and new features. Businesses expect transparency, predictability, and faster time-to-market..

That’s where **CI/CD pipelines** come in. They bridge the gap between developers and business stakeholders by ensuring code moves from idea → production smoothly, quickly, and reliably.

Let’s break this down.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
**Definition**: Developers merge their work into the main branch frequently (often several times a day), with automated builds and tests ensuring nothing is broken.

### Why it matters
- Saves countless hours wasted on merge conflicts.

- Guarantees only stable, working code enters the main branch.

- Increases confidence in the codebase.

- Works for both solo developers and teams: you can move faster without sacrificing quality.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
Definition: The practice of always having working software that could be released at any moment. Builds are automated, but releasing to production still requires manual approval.

### Why it matters
- Stakeholders don’t wait months to see progress—they can test working builds weekly or even daily.

- Teams get early feedback via TestFlight (or similar tools), improving collaboration and alignment.

- Reduces the cost and risk of releasing since a stable build is always ready.

- Transparency increases trust between developers, stakeholders, and customers.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)
Definition: Going one step further—deploying directly to production automatically whenever tests pass.

### Why it matters
- Rapid delivery of value to customers.

- Teams can adapt quickly to market changes.

- Provides a serious competitive advantage.

## Key Takeaways from My Experience
Having worked with CI/CD pipelines myself, here’s what I’ve learned:

- Set it up from day one. It saves time, reduces stress, and improves collaboration.

- Work in small batches. Fast feedback loops help validate design, requirements, and user experience early.

- Release often. Even if it’s just a prototype, frequent builds increase trust and transparency.

- Be transparent. Share progress with stakeholders—they’ll appreciate being part of the process.

- Promise fast feedback. I often tell clients: “Ask for what you want, and you’ll have a build on your phone the same day to review.”

For me, it’s always better to discover something isn’t working in 2 weeks rather than 3 months.

### Over to You
How does your team handle CI/CD?

Do you prefer manual approvals, or are you aiming for full Continuous Deployment?

I’d love to hear your experiences—please share in the comments!


For resizing the image, follow the steps below.

- Create a name for your image for the particular icon in *Assets.xcassets* folder.
- Add your image to the 1x, 2x, and 3x boxes in *Assests.xcassets* folder.
- Click on the image in each box and right-click which should reveal the options and select the option as highlighted on the screenshot below:

![Open with Editor Explorer](/assets/img/images-resize-tab-bar-icons/section-1.png "Open with Editor Explorer")

- When you click `Open with External Editor` a preview will be shown to you.

- Click on Tools` then Adjust Size` as shown below.

- Adjust the size of your image based on your requirements while keeping in mind Apple�~@~Ys human interface guidelines. Save your changes and close the window. The image in Xcode should be auto-updated. Repeat the steps for each individual icon in the 1x, 2x, and 3x sections.

Thanks for reading, I hope it helps you. Happy hacking :-)
